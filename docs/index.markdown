My name is Omer Eren. I am a 2nd year PhD student supervised by Amey Bhangale in UCR. My research interests are theory of computation and approximation algorithms. This is my project website for CS234 - Computational Methods for the Analysis of Biomolecular Data. I am planning to implement Linear-time construction of suffix trees in C++ as the course project.

Updates:

Week 5-7: Read the Ukkonen's paper. Started implementing the O(N^2) solution that will be used as baseline.
